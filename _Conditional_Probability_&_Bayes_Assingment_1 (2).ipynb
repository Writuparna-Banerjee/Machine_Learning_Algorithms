He came up with a method for calculating the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. Starting out with the prior probability (or believe) $P(A)$, when given a likelihood) $P(B\\ |\\ A)$ and evidence $P(B)$ we arrive at the posterior probability $P(A\\ |\\ B)$. Bayes Rule proves to be a powerful tool and is widely used in diverging areas like economics, artificial intelligence, medicine, journalism, military, just to name a few. Most spam filters use Bayes Rule in one way or another. The Bayes' Theorem formula is, posterior = likelihood times prior, over evidence:\n","\n","$$\n","P(A\\ |\\ B)=\\frac{P(B\\ |\\ A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n","$$\n","The practical power of Bayes Rule is that we often can't find the posterior directly, yet we do know the likelihood of the test and $P(A)$."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"JiJqw-8Gn27q","colab_type":"code","outputId":"59ddec54-38e9-4b32-f162-c72e79dcad1f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1588164625820,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4137,"user":{"displayName":"WRITUPARNA BANERJEE","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ghl9xyiy1sQf9MzkUkUCUfNw3uo_kpQiWCfbP0SlQ=s64","userId":"15352501169221010793"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["print(\"-\"*100)"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Pt-CNCwbsgIr","colab_type":"text"},"source":["\n","\n","\n","\n","Q1- What is the chance of someone having COPD (a life-threatening lung disease) given he or she is a smoker - $P(A|B)$.
